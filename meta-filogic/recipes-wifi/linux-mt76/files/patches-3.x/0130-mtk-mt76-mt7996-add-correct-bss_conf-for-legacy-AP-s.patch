Subject: [PATCH 130/199] mtk: mt76: mt7996: add correct bss_conf for legacy AP
 scan

If the legacy AP interface is added but not yet started, its bss_conf
wlould be phy0. Problem happens when scan is triggered with scan request
contining channels not belong to phy0. In other word, it is invalid to
set channel that does not belong to current bss_conf.

This commit adds correct bss_conf for legacy AP so that setting channel
can be successful.

Now AP's bss_conf is not added until chanctx being assigned, so legacy AP
might receive scan request without bss_conf being assigned. (such as ACS)

This commit changes the way bss_conf being checked before scan. If the
bss_conf exists but belongs to a different phy than the scanning one, it's
removed. And if the bss_conf is not exist, or it just be removed, it's
added and assigned to the scanning phy.
